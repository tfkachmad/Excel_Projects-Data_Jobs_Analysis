# **📊 Key Findings**

## 1️⃣ **Do More Skills Lead to Higher Salaries?**

### **🔍 Skill Used: Power Query (ETL)**

#### 📥 **Extract**

I used Power Query to extract data from `data_salary_all.xlsx` and created two queries:

- 🗃️ `data_jobs_salary` – Full job listings
- 🔧 `data_job_skills` – Skills listed for each job

#### 🔄 **Transform**

I cleaned the data by:  
- ✅ Changing column types  
- ✅ Removing unnecessary columns  
- ✅ Cleaning text & trimming spaces
- ✅ Added new columns

**🗃️ `data_jobs_salary`**

#### 📊 **Analysis & Insights**

![](../img/skills_vs_pay_scatter.png)

- 📈 **More skills = Higher salary** (especially for **Senior Data Engineers** & **Data Scientists**)
- 💼 Jobs with fewer required skills (**e.g., Business Analyst**) offer lower salaries

🤔 **Why It Matters**  
- 📌 Learning multiple relevant skills **boosts salary potential** and **career growth**.

## 2️⃣ **Salary Trends in Different Regions**

### **🧮 Skills Used: PivotTables & DAX**

📈 **Pivot Table**

- Built a **PivotTable with Power Pivot**
- Used a **DAX measure** to calculate median salary for **US jobs**

```DAX
=CALCULATE(
    MEDIAN(data_jobs_all[salary_year_avg]),
    data_jobs_all[job_country] = "United States"
)
```

#### 📊 **Analysis & Insights**  

![](../img/median_salary_by_country.png)

- 💼 **Senior Data Engineers** & **Data Scientists** earn the highest salaries globally.  
- 💰 **US-based tech jobs** pay significantly more due to the concentration of **tech industries**.

🤔 **Why It Matters**  
- 💡 Helps professionals **negotiate salaries** and **understand pay differences by region**.

## 3️⃣ **Top Skills for Data Professionals**

### **🔧 Skill Used: Power Pivot**

💪 **Power Pivot**  
- 🔗 I built a **data model** by combining the `data_jobs_all` and `data_job_skills` tables.  
- 🧹 Since the data was already **cleaned in Power Query**, Power Pivot **linked the tables automatically**.

🔗 **Data Model**  
- I created a **relationship** between the two tables using the **job_id** column.

- Used **Clustered Columns** (salaries) & **Line Markers** (skill likelihood)

#### 📊 **Analysis & Insights**  

![](../img/top_skills.png)

- 💰 **Spark, AWS, and Java** offer the highest salaries, but they appear in fewer job postings.
- 📈 While **Python and SQL** salaries are not as high as the others, these skills are the most in demand.

🤔 **Why It Matters**  
- 📌 Learning **high-value skills** (Python, SQL, Cloud Tech) leads to **higher salaries**.
